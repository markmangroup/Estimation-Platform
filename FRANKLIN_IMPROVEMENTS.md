# What We're Building for Franklin (And Why It's Better Than Excel)

**Date:** October 1, 2025

## Your Current Pain Points (We Analyzed Your Spreadsheet)

### **Template Structure:**
- **39 sheets** per estimate (Bid Summary, Bid Schedule, Prevailing Wage, Bid Bond, + 35 bid item tabs)
- **336 rows** in Bid Schedule
- **62-68 rows** per bid item tab with formulas

### **The Problems We Found:**

#### 1. **Manual NetSuite Copy/Paste Hell** ‚è±Ô∏è 5 seconds per product
**Your current workflow:**
1. Open NetSuite in another window
2. Search for product by name
3. Copy name
4. Copy standard cost
5. Switch back to Excel
6. Paste into row
7. Repeat for every single product

**With 100 products per estimate = 8+ minutes of mindless copying**

**Our fix:**
- Import all 5,247 products from Items42.xls once
- Type product name, we autocomplete
- Click to add (name + cost populate automatically)
- **Time: 5 seconds ‚Üí 1 second (80% faster)**

---

#### 2. **Broken Formulas When Inserting Rows** ‚è±Ô∏è 30 seconds per fix
**What happens:**
- Insert a row for new material
- Excel formulas reference wrong cells
- Your totals are now incorrect
- You spend time debugging which formula broke

**Our fix:**
- No formulas to break!
- Totals calculate automatically when you save
- Always correct, no debugging needed

---

#### 3. **Tab Color Coding is Clunky** ‚è±Ô∏è Lost time finding status
**Your current system:**
- üü¢ Green = Done
- üî¥ Red = Need work
- üü° Yellow = Need quote
- üü† Orange = Waiting
- ‚ö´ Black = Not needed

**Problems:**
- Right-click tab ‚Üí Change color (multiple clicks)
- Need to remember what each color means
- Can't filter by status

**Our fix:**
- Status dropdown on each bid item: "Done", "Need Work", "Need Quote", "Waiting", "Not Needed"
- Filter view: "Show me all items that need work"
- See all statuses at a glance on one page

---

#### 4. **Hyperlinks Break When Copying** ‚è±Ô∏è 10+ minutes re-finding links
**What breaks:**
- DIR wage determination links
- Equipment rental rate sheets
- Any external resource

**When you copy the spreadsheet template for a new project, links stop working.**

**Our fix:**
- Store all URLs in database
- Links never break
- Add new links once, available forever
- Team shares the same links

---

#### 5. **No Change History** ‚è±Ô∏è "Who changed this?!"
**Current problem:**
- Someone changed a cost
- You don't know who or when
- Can't undo it
- No accountability

**Our fix:**
- Activity log: "Brenda changed 'PVC Pipe 3\"' cost from $45 to $50 on Oct 1 at 2:30pm"
- See all changes
- Revert if needed
- Accountability built-in

---

#### 6. **Manual Margin Adjustments** ‚è±Ô∏è Wait for recalc, hope it's right
**Current workflow:**
- Change margin % in one cell
- Wait for Excel to recalculate
- Check if totals look right
- Repeat for each bid item

**Our fix:**
- Change margin % ‚Üí all bid items update instantly
- See sale price impact immediately
- Adjust per-item or project-wide in one click

---

#### 7. **NetSuite Export is Manual Hell** ‚è±Ô∏è 20 minutes of reformatting
**Your current process when you win:**
1. Copy data from Excel
2. Open new CSV file
3. Reformat columns to match NetSuite import format
4. Manually match Internal IDs
5. Hope you didn't miss anything
6. Import to NetSuite (fingers crossed)

**Our fix:**
- Click "Export to NetSuite"
- CSV file downloads instantly
- Pre-formatted with correct Internal IDs
- Ready to import (no manual work)
- **20 minutes ‚Üí 10 seconds**

---

#### 8. **File Locking: "Mike is Editing This File"** ‚è±Ô∏è Wasted waiting time
**Current problem:**
- Only one person can edit at a time
- Kyle is estimating Bid Item 5
- You need to update Bid Item 12
- You wait... and wait... and wait...

**Our fix:**
- Multiple people edit different bid items simultaneously
- No file locks
- No waiting
- True collaboration
