   - File location: `/Users/mike/estimation-platform/src/laurel/example_bids/Items42.xlsx`
5. Click **"Upload"**
6. Wait ~30 seconds (you'll see a loading spinner)
7. Success message appears: **"‚úì 27,063 products imported!"**

### **Step 4: Test Searching**

Now try these searches to verify it works:

**Test 1: Search by Product Name**
- Type in search box (top right of table): `PVC Pipe`
- Results appear instantly
- Check: Does the cost look right?

**Test 2: Search by Description**
- Type: `Excavator`
- See all excavator-related products
- Check: Do you recognize these?

**Test 3: Search by Internal ID**
- If you know a product's NetSuite Internal ID, search for it
- Example: Search for `107` (should find "SINGLENET INTERFACE LIGHTING...")

**Test 4: Verify Product Count**
- Scroll to bottom of table
- Should say: **"Showing 1 to 10 of 27,063 entries"**
- That's all your NetSuite products!

### **Step 5: Verify Costs**

Pick 3-5 products you use often and verify:
- Product name is correct
- Standard cost matches NetSuite

**If you find errors:**
