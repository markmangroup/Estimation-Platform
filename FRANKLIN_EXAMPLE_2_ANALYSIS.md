## ðŸŽ¯ What We Need to Match

### **1. Data Entry (Franklin's Process)**
- Enters line items manually
- Types quantity, unit, unit cost
- Excel formulas calculate totals
- Tab color shows status (ðŸŸ¢ Done, ðŸ”´ Need Work)

### **2. Our Cost Calculation**
```
Our Cost = Mobilization + Labor + Materials + Equipment + Rental + Fuel + Subs + Other
         = $3,500 + $15,003.36 + $20,903.34 + $1,500 + $900 + $0 + $0 + $0
         = $41,806.70 (before tax)
```

### **3. Tax Calculation**
```
Taxable = Materials + Rental + Fuel
        = $20,903.34 + $900 + $0
        = $21,803.34

Tax = $21,803.34 Ã— 7.75%
    = $1,689.76

Our Cost (with tax) = $41,806.70 + $1,689.76
                    = $43,496.46
```

### **4. Sale Price Calculation**
```
Margin = Our Cost Ã— Margin %
       = $43,496.46 Ã— 25%
       = $10,874.12

Sale Price = Our Cost + Margin
           = $43,496.46 + $10,874.12
           = $54,370.58
```
