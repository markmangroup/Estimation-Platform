**What this eliminates:**
- ‚ùå No more searching NetSuite for each product
- ‚ùå No more copy/paste of product names

### 2. **Product List View** - LIVE!

## üöß Not Built Yet (But Database is Ready)

### 3. **Bid Item Creation** - Backend Done, No UI Yet

**Database models exist:**
- ‚úÖ BidSchedule (master list from RFP)
- ‚úÖ BidItem (detailed estimate)
- ‚úÖ BidItemMaterial (products you import)
- ‚úÖ BidItemLabor (hours √ó rate)
- ‚úÖ BidItemEquipment (rental + fuel)

**What Franklin needs but can't see yet:**
- Create new estimate
- Add bid items from RFP
- Click bid item ‚Üí add materials (search from 27K products)
- See totals calculate automatically

**Why not built yet:**
We focused on getting product import working first so you could test with real data.

## üí° What This Proves

**Before today:**
- Franklin: "I need to copy/paste 100 products from NetSuite per estimate"
- That's 8+ minutes of manual work

**After today:**
- Franklin: "I imported all 27,063 products once in 30 seconds"
- Now search/click to add products (1 second each)
- **80% time savings per product**

**Next:** Show Franklin how to create a bid item and add materials from this catalog.

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Old .xls format**: Items42.xls is SpreadsheetML XML format, not binary .xls
   - **Fix:** We converted it to Items42.xlsx (works now)

2. **Column name differences**: NetSuite exports "Standard Cost", we expected "Std Cost"
   - **Fix:** Import now accepts both column names

3. **Missing columns**: Franklin's file only has 4 columns (Name, Description, Standard Cost, Internal ID)
   - **Fix:** Made all other columns optional with sensible defaults

## üìû Questions for Franklin

1. **Are the product costs correct?**
   - Check a few products you know well
   - Report any that seem wrong

2. **Any products missing from the 27,063?**
   - Search for products you use often
   - Let us know if key items are missing

3. **How do you want to organize bid items?**
   - By RFP item code (e.g., "100", "200")?
   - By description?
   - What order do you typically work through them?

4. **What's your typical bid item workflow?**
   - Start with materials?
   - Start with labor?
   - Start with equipment?
   - This will guide how we design the bid item detail page

---

**Bottom line:** Franklin now has all 27,063 NetSuite products in the web app. Next step: Let him create a bid item and search/add products from this catalog.
