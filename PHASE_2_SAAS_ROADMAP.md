# Phase 2: SaaS Transformation Roadmap
## Estimation Platform for Agriculture Industry

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025
**Target Market:** Agriculture contractors, irrigation companies, landscape design firms
**Vision:** Transform the Estimation Platform into a user-friendly, multi-tenant SaaS product that replaces manual estimation processes with automated, professional workflows.

---

## Executive Summary

The current Estimation Platform is a functional single-tenant application designed for irrigation and agricultural estimation. Phase 2 will transform it into a true SaaS product with:

- **Multi-tenant architecture** - Multiple companies/organizations using isolated data
- **Simplified onboarding** - Non-technical users can get started in minutes
- **Template-based workflows** - Pre-built estimation templates for common agriculture scenarios
- **Monetization strategy** - Tiered subscription pricing with clear value propositions
- **Mobile-first experience** - Work from the field on tablets/phones
- **Integration capabilities** - Connect to QuickBooks, Xero, and other business tools

---

## Current State Analysis

### What Works Well
1. **8-Stage Estimation Workflow** - Solid foundation for the core process:
   - Select Task Codes
   - Upload CAD Files
   - Material List Generation
   - Task Mapping
   - Generate Estimate
   - Proposal Creation
   - Proposal Preview
   - Final Document Export

2. **Rich Data Models** - Comprehensive entities:
   - Opportunities (projects/jobs)
   - Customers with billing addresses
   - Products with cost tracking (internal_id, std_cost, preferred_vendor)
   - Tasks with descriptions
   - Vendors
   - Labour costs (local/out-of-town rates)
   - Additional materials with factors

3. **Document Management** - File uploads and tracking
4. **DataTables Integration** - Filtering, searching, sorting capabilities
5. **Real-time Updates** - AJAX-based UI updates

### Critical Gaps for SaaS
1. **No Multi-Tenancy** - All data shared across users
2. **Single User Model** - No organization/company hierarchy
3. **Complex Onboarding** - Requires technical setup (database, Azure storage, etc.)
4. **No Subscription/Billing** - No payment processing
5. **Hard-coded Business Logic** - Tax rates, margins specific to one company
6. **No Template Library** - Users start from scratch every time
7. **Limited Mobile Experience** - Desktop-focused UI
8. **Manual Data Entry** - No CSV import for products/customers (only opportunities)
9. **No API** - Can't integrate with other tools

---

## Phase 2 Roadmap: 6-Month Sprint Plan
### **USER-FIRST APPROACH: Build what customers see and love FIRST, then add backend infrastructure**

**Philosophy:** We're NOT building a "SaaS platform" - we're building a tool that helps contractors win more bids and get paid faster. The infrastructure (multi-tenancy, billing, APIs) comes AFTER we prove people love using it.

**Sprint Order Reasoning:**
1. **Sprints 1-2:** Templates & quick wins (users see value in 10 minutes)
2. **Sprints 3-4:** Beautiful UI & mobile (users love using it daily)
3. **Sprints 5-6:** CSV import & onboarding (remove friction to get started)
4. **Sprints 7-8:** Insights & reporting (users make better business decisions)
5. **Sprints 9-10:** Multi-tenancy (NOW we scale to multiple companies)
6. **Sprints 11-12:** Payments (NOW we collect revenue)

**This order ensures:**
- Early user testing with real contractors (week 4)
- Proven product-market fit before scaling infrastructure (week 16)
- Revenue generation only after users are hooked (week 24)

                accepted_at__isnull=False
            ).select_related('organization').first()

            if membership:
                request.organization = membership.organization
                request.user_role = membership.role
            else:
                request.organization = None
                request.user_role = None

        return self.get_response(request)
